# Shortcut_maker v0.0.1

**Simple desktops task automatization**

Main idea was simplifying life (going from 15 clicks to 3 clicks of mouse).

This basically is simple "menu" of presets for my personal use (opening same apps in different workspaces/desktops, by same scenario)


**Supported:**
- Windows 10


**Required:**
- Python installed
- Eel library installed
- Define your presets in .py file (soon will be added other options)


## About

Script opens web based GUI menu for choosing preset. Then script opens needed apps in defined workspaces/desktops. This simply automates my routine. Project made for fun and because I'm too lazy.   


## Installation
- Just download new version of program
- Download all required software(Python and Eel library)
- Extract files from archive to folder you want
- Find in that folder "short_cut.py" - setup program for yourself (maybe change or add smth. Soon I will make this process a little bit easier) and run program
- Done âœ”
	- Now you saved 1 second of your life and made me happy (not sure)

## In future:

Changes on the horizon. New releases, new updates and of course new features will be added as soon as I can make them (or if I want to). Project already sutisfied me and I can now save 1 second for myself and just watch how my routine is performed by script.

Know other methods, or want me to add something new please write me [here (Mail)](mailto:olegpapka2@gmail.com) or [here (Telegram)](https://t.me/oleg_folder) or now you can contact me [here (my website)](https://olegpapka.tk).

**Soon:**
- [ ] New presets
- [ ] New settings
- [ ] And I will find way how to do it even faster and save for myself a few milliseconds more
